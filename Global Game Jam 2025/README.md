# Global Game Jam 2025 submission: Bubble Gun

## My Role
I developed the behavior of the enemies you fight in the game. This included path finding, methods of attack, and spawning. Enemy spawning was the most difficult aspect of this role as I had to figure out a way to spawn them randomly in a way that was not unfair. I ended limiting spawning so that enemies could not spawn inside of the player and used a spawner object that is invisible to the player to spawn them in.
