# Embedded Security System Project
This was a large group project where 15 of us worked on different parts of a theoretical embedded security system. We completed user stories, used GitHub to ensure a stable workflow. The work was done in two sprints where we programmed a module which included either a sensor or an actuator in the first sprint and debuged another group members module in the second sprint. We did not end up having time to fully integrate the modules. I am including only the module that I programmed which was a large motor that was intended to be used as a lock in a final product.
### To run this program you need a stepper motor and a motor controller. The software must be compiled onto and Arduino board. Please see the README in the lock_actuator folder for further information
## hardware used
- stepper motor and motor controller
- XIAO ESP32C3: Arduino development board
- breadboard
- breadboard wires
### Photohraphs of the hardware setup are included in lock_actuator/hello/
