This repository is a collection of notable projects revolving around computer science that I have worked on so far. This is currently an incomplete list.

Each folder represents a different project

# Project Overviews:
## Organized/Official Projects
- Global Game Jam 2025: Worked in a group to program a game in Unity for a 72 hour game jam
